      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Hailing from sunny Santa Monica, Rashid has lived most of his life around the beach.  
          He wishes he could become an avid surfer but he doesn't like to wake up early.
          He smokes a lot, and he does mean a lot of pot.  
          He is currently in the process of trying to smoke less pot... but life is real.  
          He really wants to work for a company that values him and doesn't view him simply as another 'replaceable cog'.  
          He is usually uncomfortable reffering to himself in the third person, but you know, he has to make a first webpage.
